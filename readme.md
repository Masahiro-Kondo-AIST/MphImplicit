This repository contains programs for conducting particle based fluid simulation
using MPH-I (Moving Particle Hydrodynamics for Incompressible) method. 


# Directories
The directories in the repository is as follows:  

```
MphImplicit 
     |--- generator
     |--- results
     |--- source

```        

# How to execute samples

1."generator" is for pre-process. To compile it, run
```
> make 
```
in generator directory. (g++ is to be installed)

2."results" contains sample cases for the calculation. 
In a case directory, execute

```
> ./generate.sh
```

The generator will be launched and particles will be generated
reading cubolid file (*.boid).

3."source" contains the main solver for MPH-I calculations. 
To complie it , run

```
> make 
```
in the source directory. Then, an executable "MphImplicit", 
which is for 2D single thread calculation, is created with g++. 

4.Then, back to the case directory, and launch

```
> ./execute.sh
```
Make sure that the execute.sh points the correct executable. 

The solver starts with reading parameter file (*.data) 
and particle file (*.grid). 
The series of calculation results (*.vtk) are output,  
and they can be visualized with a viewer like ParaView. 
(https://www.paraview.org/)


# Using openMP, openACC and CUDA
You may switch the compilation by the targets of "make".
For 3D single thread calculation with g+;
```
> make MphImplicit_3d
``` 
For 2D OpenMP calculation with g++;
```
> make Mph_gcc
``` 
For 3D OpenMP calculation with g++; 
```
> make Mph_gcc3d
``` 
For 2D OpenACC calculation with NVIDIA HPC-SDK;
```
> make Mph_acc
``` 
For 3D OpenACC calculation with NVIDIA HPC-SDK;
```
> make Mph_acc3d
``` 
See "makefile" in detail. 

Instead of switching the target executable as above, 
You may switch the compiler and its options directly. 
 
The solver program has only been tested with 
   g++ 7.5.0.   and   NVIDIA HPC-SDK 21.5 with CUDA version 11.3.
So, they are recomended though compatible versions may work. 


# Generating particles 
Initial particle disturiburion in combination of cuboids 
can be generated by editting the cuboid file (*.boid) and using the generator. 
For distribution including shape other than cuboid, particles 
are to be generated in other way such as making a new program for it.   
  
In the main solver, the particle types are defined as
- 0: fluid 
- 1: fluid
- 2: wall
- 3: wall
- 4: wall
- 5 and over: many body

Therefore, 2 fluid types, 3 wall types and 1 many body solid can be used in the solver. 
To change tne number of types, the main solver is to be modified. 

# Changing physical properties 
The physical properties and calculation conditions are given in 
the parameter file (*.data). By editting the file, the physical 
properties can be changed. 


# For 3D calculation 
Particle distribution in 3D can be generated only by editing the 
cuboid file (*.boid) No modification in the generator program is needed. 
With solvers compiled for 3D, 3D calculation can be conducted. 
  

# For Truning off Multigrid solver
When you do not want to apply the multigrid preconditioner, 
just comment out the macro MULTIGRID_SOLVER in "main.cpp".  
Then, the simple CR solver is applied in the calculation.
